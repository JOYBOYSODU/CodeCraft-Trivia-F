## 🎯 Use Case Examples

### Example 1: New Player (First Login)
```
User: Logs in first time
System: 
  ├─ Detects first-time (no ai_rec_seen flag)
  ├─ Shows WelcomeRecommendModal
  └─ "View My Roadmap" button shown

User: Clicks [View My Roadmap]
System:
  ├─ Navigates to /practice
  ├─ Loads playerData from localStorage
  ├─ No cache exists → calls Gemini
  ├─ Shows loading skeleton
  ├─ After 3-5s → displays recommendations
  └─ Sets ai_rec_seen_${userId} flag

Result: 
├─ 8 unsolved problems in priority order
├─ 2 already-solved problems marked complete
├─ Weekly goal: "3 problems this week"
└─ Focus topic: "Stack Fundamentals"
```

### Example 2: Returning User (Same Day)
```
User: Navigates to /practice
System:
  ├─ Loads playerData from localStorage
  ├─ Checks cache: "ai_recommendations_${userId}"
  ├─ Cache fresh (3 hours old < 24h)
  ├─ Returns cached instantly ⚡
  └─ "Last updated 3 hours ago"

Result:
└─ Same roadmap loads in <100ms
   (no API call needed!)
```

### Example 3: Manual Refresh
```
User: Clicks [🔄 Refresh Recommendations]
System:
  ├─ Shows confirmation modal
  ├─ "Regenerate? Uses 1 AI credit"
  
User: Clicks [Regenerate]
System:
  ├─ clearRecommendationCache()
  ├─ Removes from localStorage
  ├─ Shows loading skeleton again
  ├─ Calls Gemini fresh
  ├─ After 3-5s → new recommendations
  └─ Updates localStorage with new timestamp

Result:
└─ Fresh AI analysis based on current data
```
